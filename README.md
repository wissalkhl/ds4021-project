# Section 1: Software and Platforms Used #

The attached jupyter notebook files were created in VSCode and Google Colab, where Python3 was used to run both of them. There are four main jupyter notebooks for each of the four predictive models we created, as well as one for descriptive analysis (some summary statistics and exploratory visualizations) and a notebook for testing the optimal models and their specific hyperparameters on the test data originally included in this repository. The packages that were used to create these notebooks are pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, and PyTorch. Finally, the operating system used to run these notebooks is MacOS.
